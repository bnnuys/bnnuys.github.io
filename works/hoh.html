        <b><a href="https://colrana.neocities.org/hoh">play online!</a></b>
        <p>A twine project about memory through music, online identity and online archiving.</p>
          <p>The amount of voice memos that I’ve left for myself is what drives this project.
          That and the various small pieces of music I’ve played around since I was little,
          involving vocal covers and other such things, to audio introductions and more.
          </p>
          <p>There's not much else to add other than I want to experiment with text and audio,
          kinda going through an introspective of my life alongside music, branching off to
          thoughts, to ideas, to contexts and what I gravitated towards.
