          <h2>Bear (2019 - Ongoing)</h2>
          <p>Bear is just a bear that I stumbled across one day in a Miniso store. He was all alone and 
            the only one left of his kind. He has then joined my life and has wowed many people with how cute 
            and fuzzy he is, but he is really showing his age now! They grow up so fast! He is also 
            very sensitive to the world around him, and prefers to be squished and cuddled with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bear has been a part of one performance piece where I told his tale and passed him around 
            a group of people. He has also recently been a part of an installation piece called "Home Work" (2022).
            Bear also has a best friend called Bunny and they both love being around each other! They both 
            currently live in my home.
