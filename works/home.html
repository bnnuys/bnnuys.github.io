          <h2>Homebody (2024)</h2>
          <p>"Assuming the role of a disembodied scientist, the filmmaker playfully interacts with fragments of a house as its own being. Showcasing the home in Petri dishes, Homebody documents breaking down and growing elements of a contained domestic space."</p>
            <p>Personal identity within a childhood home becomes the home itself. It is shaped by the tenants inside and the events that surround it. Your memories embed themselves into the walls and the furnishings and like a very bad stain, don’t just leave.</p>
          <p>A petri dish provides me with a spectator seat as well as a direct way to interact with my subject. Blue gloved hands that aren’t recognizable of my own dominate this world, and it controls what interacts with who. If my house cannot be properly seen because of my whims, I may as well test it. Prod it. Observe it multiplying itself and transforming itself within its own confines. </p>
        <p>Screened as a part of Gallery Gachet's film programme <i>To Map Alongside Belonging</i> and launched Gallery Gachet’s community screen alongside other BIPOC cohort filmmakers.</p>
          <p>Full resolution viewing of this film is available by request.</p>
