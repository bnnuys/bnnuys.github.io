          <h2>Memory Processing Unit (2021)</h2>
          <b><a href="https://colrana.itch.io/memory-processing-unit">download link</a></b>
          <p>How does our memory work? How does computer memory work?
            Can we represent our memory’s biased, easily influenced nature to a computer?
            These are all questions I had while creating the <b>Memory Processing Unit (MPU)</b>.</p>
           <p>Originally, this project was centered around a single video I made during my foundation year.
            The video was made with the prompt of a <em>“Self Portrait Without Yourself”</em>. The result was a video
            that centered around my life at home, sharing a room with my sister. I wanted to revisit that video
            because it was made during the same time of year as I would be making this work in 2021. I wanted
            whatever result came out of revisiting that video to be my output and my finished product.
           </p>
            <p>In a turn of events, I found myself creating a system that became more and more intricate as the time
            went on. This system was originally a second thought, a means to an end for the output I wanted. However,
            during a demonstration of my work in progress, I realized how important this system was to my goal of
            refabricating my own memories and mediating them through a computer system. This shifted my view from
            this being a project about a video I created in my first year, to a system that I would like to apply
            to future projects and to share amongst other people so they can generate their own content, however that may
            look.
